EmoBytes is an easy solution to storing massive amounts of data connected to dates and other attributes remotely!

Setup
=====================================
Setup is easy! All you need to do is: 
1. Install Play! Framework (http://www.playframework.org/) 
2. Download this bundle 
3. Navigate to the file directory within Terminal 
4. Run the command: play 'run 8079' 
5. You're up and running! 

To make sure you're up, navigate to 'localhost:8079' within your browser of preference.
You should see a screen asking you to do an evolution (modify the tables). Just click yes.
Then you'll be taken to your main page!

(To Travis) 
You need to setup the three components in this order: 
1. Java server (this) 
2. Pinger (JSONBackend) 
3. NodeEPOC 

Also, you need to create an account and an appUUID for yourself: 
1. Signup 
2. Go to your homepage 
3. Create a new app 
4. You should see the appUUID 
5. Enter this command in Terminal: curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Accept: application/json" -X POST -d '{"person":{"appUUID":"(Enter your appUUID here)", "clientUUID":"981"}, "Post":{"EPOC":{"Angry":"25", "Meditative":"16"}, "WebCam":{"isBlinking":"false"}}, "appName":"Internet Explorer", "email":"(Enter your email here)"}' localhost:8079/detect.json 
6. You'll receive a clientUUID back. This will be your new clientUUID 
7. Use your appUUID, clientUUID, and email for the next few steps.
